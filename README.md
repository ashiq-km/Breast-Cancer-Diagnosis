# 🩺 Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts whether a breast cancer case is **Malignant** or **Benign** using clinical diagnostic data.

This model uses **Logistic Regression** and is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
- Built using **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**
- Preprocessed and scaled input features
- Model trained with `class_weight='balanced'`
- Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score

---

## ⚙️ Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py



📊 Example Output

The app predicts:
